# Quantum Computing Exploration

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks exploring various concepts in quantum computing.

## Notebooks

### 1. `QC_ASSIGNMENT.ipynb`

This notebook contains a series of assignments and exercises related to quantum computing. It covers a wide range of topics, providing hands-on experience with quantum algorithms and concepts.
a
### 2. `QFT.ipynb`

This notebook focuses on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). It includes:
- The mathematical background of the QFT.
- Implementation of the QFT circuit.
- Examples and applications of the QFT.

### 3. `Quantum_Gates.ipynb`

This notebook provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental quantum gates. It includes:
- Explanations of single-qubit gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, Y, Z).
- Explanations of multi-qubit gates (CNOT, SWAP, Toffoli).
- Circuit implementations and visualizations of these gates.

## How to Run

To run these notebooks, you will need to have a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook and the following libraries installed:
- qiskit
- numpy
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using pip:
```bash
pip install jupyter qiskit numpy matplotlib
```

Then, you can launch Jupyter Notebook and open the desired `.ipynb` file.
